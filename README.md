# Hey, I’m Rishabh
I’m a backend engineer with an interest in databases and distributed systems.

Currently working on an interesting kernel microvisor: [Lind](https://github.com/Lind-Project/lind-wasm/)

I love to build systems from scratch:
- [A SQLite file format reader that runs faster than SQLite](https://github.com/rishabhBudhouliya/gosqlite)
- [Re-writing the SQLite reader with no GC in Zig](https://github.com/rishabhBudhouliya/ZIGLite)

Previously,
- Worked as a software engineer at [Narvar](https://corp.narvar.com/) for 4 years
- [I’ve contributed to Jenkins to improve their performance](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin/pull/931)

I’m currently pursuing a master's in Computer Engineering from NYU.
